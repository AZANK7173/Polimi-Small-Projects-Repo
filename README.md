# Polimi Projects Repository

Welcome to my University Projects repository! This is a collection of small projects I worked on during my time at university. Each project showcases my learning and development in various subjects, including programming, algorithms, data analysis, and more.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

1. **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning projects:** projects related to Deep Learning, ranging from Image Classification with CNNs until Time Series classification with LSTMs
2. **Data Quality:** Performance comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms when outliers are inserted (and consequent outlier removal techniques)  
3. **Foundations of Operation Research:** Codes using the `mip` library in order to optmize a complex optimization in a biogas production problem
4. **Software Requirements using Alloy:** Developing constrains in software and simulatiing objects using Alloy.
